            Buy low and sell high in this chaotic stock simulation! Made with Unity, in 2015.

            Stocks are not simply random, but stochastically change between several different patterns, so players can eventually
            discover and take advantage of them. 

            Originally, this game was made as a tool to help with world building. I was writing the history for a set of
            worlds called "Terre" and "Thargon", which is why these names appear in the game.
